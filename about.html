    <h2>About Pi Smart Home</h2>
    <p>Pi Smart Home was created by a group of makers who wanted to share their experience building smart home projects with Raspberry Pi. We believe technology should be open, accessible and empowering. Our guides focus on solving real problems — from reading temperature and humidity to switching appliances and installing sophisticated home automation software — without requiring any prior electronics experience.</p>
    <p>All of the content on this site is free. We occasionally include affiliate links to gear that we personally use; if you click through and make a purchase we may earn a small commission. This helps us maintain the site and continue to create new tutorials.</p>
    <p>If you have questions, suggestions or want to share a project idea, please get in touch via <a href="mailto:info@pisnarthome.local">email</a>. We love hearing from the community!</p>
