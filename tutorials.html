    <h2>Tutorials</h2>
    <p>Below you'll find practical guides for building smart home projects with Raspberry Pi. Each tutorial includes wiring instructions, code examples and tips to help you succeed.</p>

      <h3 id="dht22">Reading Temperature &amp; Humidity with a DHT22 Sensor</h3>
      <p>The DHT22 is a low‑cost sensor that measures temperature and humidity. It's more accurate than the older DHT11 and outputs a digital signal every two seconds. To connect it to a Raspberry Pi, wire the leftmost pin to 3–5 V, the second pin to a GPIO data pin and the rightmost pin to ground. Modules often include the necessary resistor so you only need three wires.</p>
      <p>Install the Adafruit library via terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
 sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
</code></pre>
      <p>Then create a Python script to read the sensor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
 import Adafruit_DHT
 import time

 SENSOR = Adafruit_DHT.DHT22
 PIN    = 4  # change to the GPIO pin you connected

 while True:
     humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(SENSOR, PIN)
     if humidity is not None and temperature is not None:
         print(f"Temp: {temperature:.1f}°C  Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")
     else:
         print("Failed to retrieve data from sensor")
     time.sleep(2)
</code></pre>
      <p>This script reads and prints the sensor values every two seconds. It will help you monitor conditions in your home or greenhouse. For best accuracy, use a pull‑up resistor between VCC and the data pin if you're working with a bare sensor instead of a module.</p>

      <h3 id="relay">Switching Appliances with a Relay Module</h3>
      <p>A relay lets your Pi safely control high‑voltage devices. The module has input pins (VCC, GND, IN) and output terminals (COM, NO, NC). Connect VCC to your Pi's 3.3 V, GND to ground and IN to a GPIO pin. The high‑voltage device connects to the common (COM) and normally open (NO) terminals. When the input pin goes high the relay closes and power flows to the device.</p>
      <p>For multi‑channel boards with optocouplers, connect JD_VCC to 5 V and VCC to 3.3 V to avoid voltage mismatch. The following Python code toggles the relay on and off:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
 import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
 import time

 RELAY_PIN = 17  # update to your GPIO number

 GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
 GPIO.setup(RELAY_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

 try:
     while True:
         GPIO.output(RELAY_PIN, GPIO.HIGH)
         print("Relay ON")
         time.sleep(5)
         GPIO.output(RELAY_PIN, GPIO.LOW)
         print("Relay OFF")
         time.sleep(5)
 except KeyboardInterrupt:
     pass
 finally:
     GPIO.cleanup()
</code></pre>
      <p>This loop energises the relay for five seconds and then turns it off. Replace the prints with your own logic to control lights, fans or pumps. Always test with low‑voltage devices first and never touch exposed mains wires.</p>

      <h3 id="homeassistant">Installing Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi</h3>
      <p>Home Assistant is an open‑source platform that centralises control of smart devices. To run it on a Raspberry Pi, you need a Pi 5 or 4 with at least 2 GB of RAM, a 32 GB (A2) microSD card, a power supply and Ethernet cable. Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the Home Assistant OS onto the SD card: choose <em>Other specific‑purpose OS → Home assistants and home automation → Home Assistant OS</em> and write it. Insert the card, connect Ethernet and power, then wait a few minutes and navigate to <code>http://homeassistant.local:8123</code> on your computer.</p>
      <p>Follow the on‑screen setup to create an account and start integrating devices. Home Assistant runs as a dedicated operating system, so you don't need to install anything else. It's a great way to manage multiple sensors, switches and automations from a single interface.</p>
